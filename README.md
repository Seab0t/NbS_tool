## 2. Heat Risk Index
**Definition**  
Heat Risk Index: Conceptualized using Crichton's Risk Triangle framework, which defines risk as the interaction of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability components. The index is calculated as the sum of these three components:
     ```
     HRI = Hazard + Exposure + Vulnerability
     ```

### Study Period & Criteria
- **Date range**: Heat-wave days from **2017â€“2023**  
  Chosen because NYC land-use change was < 10 % during this period ([USFS LCMS](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USFS_GTAC_LCMS_v2023-9#description)).  
- **Heat wave**: â‰¥ 3 consecutive days with daily highs â‰¥ 90 Â°F ([NOAA OKX](https://www.weather.gov/okx/excessiveheat)).  
  
---

### Component Datasets

1. **Hazard**  
   - **LST**: Mean Land Surface Temperature during heat waves (radiative surface heat).

2. **Exposure**  
   - **PopDen**: Population density (people /kmÂ²)  
   - **RoadD**: Pedestrian demand Ã— road length per grid cell  

3. **Vulnerability**  
   - **Vegetation & Built Environment**  
     - **NDVI**: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index  
     - **NDBI**: Normalized Difference Built-up Index  
     - **NDWI**: Normalized Difference Water Index  
     - **ParkArea**: Park area (kmÂ²)  
   - **Socioeconomic**  
     - **MedianInc**: Median household income  
     - **Race_Black**, **Race_Latin**, **Race_Other**: % of each group  
     - **Home_AC**: % of households with at least one functioning AC  
   - **Health & Social Support**  
     - **Hos_D**: Hospital density (/kmÂ²)  
     - **Hypertensi**: % of adults diagnosed with hypertension  
     - **Helpful_Ne**: % of adults reporting neighbor support  
   - **Age Vulnerability**  
     - **Pop5P**: % of population under 5 years  
     - **Pop65P**: % of population over 65 years  

> _All remote-sensing indices (NDVI, NDBI, NDWI) are derived from Landsat 8 averages over heat wave days (2017â€“2023)._

### Methodology

1. **Normalization**  
   - Scaled to the range [0.1, 0.9] using MinMaxScaler[^2].  
   - **Negative** variables (higher â†’ lower risk):  
     NDVI, NDWI, MedianInc, ParkArea, Hos_D, Home_AC, Helpful_Ne  
   - **Positive** variables (higher â†’ higher risk):  
     LST, PopDen, RoadD, NDBI, Pop5P, Pop65P, Race_Black, Hypertensi  

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**  
   - PCA on the 14 vulnerability metrics, retaining â‰¥ 85 % of total variance (Pareto principle).  

3. **Aggregation**
     ```
     HRI = Hazard + Exposure + Vulnerability
     ```
